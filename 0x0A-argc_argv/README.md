1...Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
so i printed argc-1 so as to make the program  start printing at zero
2...Write a program that prints all arguments it receives.

All arguments should be printed, including the first one
Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line
used a for loop ,used i for indexing,looped through the argc and incremented, then printed argv[i]..easy peasy
