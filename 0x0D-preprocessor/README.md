Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.01
****The #ifndef directive of the C Programming Language helps in allowing the conditional compilation. The C Programming Languageâ€™s preprocessor helps in determining only if the macro provided is not at all existed before including the specific subsequent code in the C compilation process. The #ifndef preprocessor only checks If the specific macro is not at all defined with the help of the #define directive. If the condition is TRUE then it will be helpful in executing the code otherwise the else code of the #ifndef will be compiled or executed only if present.
The #define creates a macro, which is the association of an identifier or parameterized identifier with a token string. After the macro is defined, the compiler can substitute the token string for each occurrence of the identifier in the source file.\
n the C Programming Language, the #endif directive closes off the following directives: #if, #ifdef, or #ifndef. When the #endif directive is encountered, preprocessing of the opening directive (#if, #ifdef, or #ifndef) is completed.
